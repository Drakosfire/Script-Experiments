					<h5 id="user-monster-description">Once a cheerful and benign spirit
 of the forest, Ebony has been corrupted by dark magic, transforming her
 into a sinister force of malevolence. Despite her tiny stature, her 
powers have grown exponentially. Her once fairy-like aura now radiates 
dread, and she is capable of casting deadly spells that can reduce any 
foe to dust. Ebony delights in tormenting the innocent and disrupting 
the natural balance of the world.</h5>
