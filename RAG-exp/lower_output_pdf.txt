the mission
hrogar can share the following information with the
adventures about manke:
• find manke, take the sword from him anyway you can,
humiliate or kill him, whatever suits your style. killing him
won’t violate the laws of glip dak. hrogar will see to that.
• he has been attempting to convert others to his banner,
forming a sort of church militant.
• it is important to the functioning of glip dak that one
religion does not rise to control the city. a theocracy would
be devastating, especially one as violent as maglubiyet.
a successful dc 15 intelligence (religion) check recalls
that hobgoblins are supposed to worship maglubiyet with
fanatical zeal, with few exceptions. glip dak hosts few
religious shrines or temples. the kroth magg say this is an
issue of attracting trade and making others feel comfortable
and safe within glip dak as maglubiyet demands sacrific-
es.
about the sword
the sword has quite the history. it was once wielded by
the troll mercenary arrk before he disappeared into the
ruins below glip dak.
• the sword was recovered from there not long ago and
fell into the possession of manke.
• the sword is of netherese make and when drawn, the
blade bleeds. from what little we know, this must be some
kind of benign curse, well, unless you’re squeamish around
blood.
• at the center of its guard is a magical gem, which once
allowed the sword to capture and cast powerful magic.
however, something unusual is now within the sword
preventing this ability.

freeing the prisoner
the guards are cold and bored. if asked, they tell the
adventurers that the imprisoned hobgoblin is named huul,
and she stuck a dagger in a goblin during a bar fight. be-
cause of this murder, she owes a blood debt of 50 gp to the huul and the pakk vit

“you picked a good day to die in glip dak.
glad i get to see this fun.” she starts laughing
at her joke, and then abruptly stops. “who are
you, and why are you here in glip dak?”
when the adventurers free her, she cuts her hand with a
silver dagger bearing a symbol, swearing an oath to them.
on a successful dc 15 intelligence (religion) check, the
adventurers identify the symbol on the dagger as that of
bargrivyek, the hobgoblin god of duty and discipline, who
was defeated and enslaved by the goblin god maglubiyet.
huul and her blood debt
huul owes the adventurers a debt, and she’s eager to
even the score and be free. she will follow non-suicidal
orders and throws herself into combat with fervor. once
she has partaken in one combat with the adventurers, she
declares that her debt is paid, and attempts to leave.
after her debt is settled, huul can be persuaded to stay
and act as a guide. in payment, she asks for a martial weap-
on and armor. if armed and armored, she keeps these items
at the end of the adventure and does not return them.
for purposes of glip dak, huul does not count as an
npc regarding experience earned.
huul knows where the worghide villa is located. if the
adventurers are open about their goal to rescue elias van-
dover, she’s able to guide them. she is also familiar with
manke, owner of arrk’s greatsword, by reputation only—
that of a bully and zealot.
if huul is not freed, she is no longer in the hanging
cage when the adventurers pass back this way. if asked,
the guards laugh and mention the goblins came and took
vengeance for their slain kin.
huul will not willingly give up her silver dagger. the
dagger is a symbol of her honor and prowess. the only
way to take it is by her death.
where to now
the adventurers can proceed to manke or to free elias in
any order.
treasure
if huul dies any time during glip dak, her dagger can
be claimed. it is a non-magical silver dagger that bears the
rune of bargrivyek, the hobgoblin god of duty and disci-
pline, and is worth 75 gp if sold.

running this adventure at a convention
there is a lot to do in beneath glip dak, but if you hap-
pen to be running it on a tight timeline, you will probably
have to streamline it. use the adventure summary on
page 3 and the story beats for each part as a roadmap, and
consider the below suggestions for running this adventure
when you only have a two-hour slot.
• part 1: have an npc (hrogar or strenkl) give more of
an info dump up front, and/or volunteer extra information
during the roleplay encounter. if harpers are in the group,
give them the extra information that strob was burgled and
no longer has the box.
• part 2: omit 2c. have slobar give more of an info

e. raxivort, arise!
in the main chamber of grimyton, speaker uublix (a
warlock of the archfey) is finishing the final steps in cast-
ing conjure fey, mistakenly thinking he will cause raxivort
to appear.
read or paraphrase the following:
in the main chamber, some two dozen xvarts
are watching a tall gold-robed xvart standing
atop a mound of coins, silverware, rugs, and the
like, intoning words of power.
before him is a censer with scented smoke
wafting towards the ceiling. behind the xvart,
partly concealed in the shadows, is the hulking
figure of a giant rat-beast.

uublix has unwittingly made a warlock pact with an
unknown otherworldly being but assumes the patron is
really raxivort. as speaker of the xvart tribe, uublix has
“supreme authority over grimyton”, and loves to let the
other xvarts know it.

fight
if the party arrives at the xvart main chamber without
slobar, and doesn’t stop the summoning ceremony, a fight
is inevitable as uublix cries out for his tribe to “destroy the
intruders!”
if they do stop the ceremony, see the negotiate section
above.
at the completion of uublix’s ceremony, he casts conjure
fey, believing he is summoning the xvart god. a number of
things happen:
• a fey creature is summoned to the chamber. see “ad-

warlock of the archfey. uublix is completely insane and
has made the broad leap that since he summoned an ally
instead of his god, he must be a god! he is still a craven
god, however, and will use his magic, outside of cantrips,
mainly to keep away from danger by using misty step. the
first time he takes damage, he will use misty escape. for
offense, he uses eldritch blast.
half-ogre/ogre. rattus is a large, not-at-all-bright brute.
unbidden, he will attack the nearest creature who is not
blue (wild magic sorcerers who have recently surged and
rolled a 23-24 will find this to their advantage).
meenlock. the meenlock will attack as ublix com-
mands. it will make use of shadow teleport as much as
possible, mainly to get out of melee. if uublix loses con-
centration, the meenlock will target him solely.
redcap. the redcap will attack as ublix commands.
given the chance, it will use ironbound pursuit, otherwise
it will use its wicked sickle. if uublix loses concentration,
the redcap will target him solely, taking special delight if it
can knock the xvart off his stilts.
yeth hound. the yeth hound will alternate using its bay
and its bite, attacking as uublix commands. if uublix loses
concentration, the yeth hound will target him solely.

the npc providing the mission warns the adventurers
that thar can be quite cold this time of year, and to make
sure to purchase cold-weather gear if they don’t already
have some or if it hasn’t already been provided (see the
extreme cold sidebar).
extreme cold
whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees
fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on
a dc 10 constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
or gain one level or exhaustion. creatures with resistance
or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the
saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear
(thick coats, gloves, and the like), and creatures naturally
adapted to cold climates.
travel to the citadel is not covered in this module be-
cause of the adventure’s time restraints. however, if time
is not an issue, then the level 1-5 arctic encounters table
can be used from xanathar’s guide to everything, page 92.
tricks of the trade
travel: if handwaving travel runs against the style of
game being played, travel may be a series of random
encounters presented in xanathar’s guide to everything in
addition to dealing with the challenges of cold weather (see
extreme cold sidebar).

general features
the githyanki citadel has the following features.
terrain. the citadel is sunken into the bog, tilting the
entire structure. it is carved from a single, massive tooth.
a successful dc 18 intelligence (arcana) check identifies
that this molar-like tooth came from a titanic creature
belonging to the far realm. detect magic reveals that the
tooth was shaped using immense psionic powers.
weather. the inside of the citadel is dry and cold.
light. all rooms (a-u) are brightly lit by red-hued orbs
set into the ceiling. occasionally the orbs flicker in unison,
plunging the citadel into brief spasms of abject darkness
and bright light.
smells and sounds. it smells like death throughout the
citadel. unless prevented, everyone within the citadel hears
continuous telepathic whispering in gith. the whispers are
repeatedly telling the story of the citadel’s final days (see
the adventure background).
tracks. there are numerous tracks, both humanoid and
animal, throughout the area. they are fresh, within the last
day or so (see tracks below for more details).

treasure
if the adventurers haven’t already found the mithral half
plate and dread helm, they can be found on the enemies
defeated in this room. these treasures can only be awarded
once, so if the armor or helm are found elsewhere in the
citadel, it isn’t found here.
the adventurers also find 55 gp in various coinage.
siding with the githyanki
siding with the githyanki at this point should be diffi-
cult. the gith don’t differentiate among non-gith except
for elves, who they have encountered in astral space in
elvish ships and who they view with annoyance instead of
abject disdain.

nearly anything to keep it, including siding with the adven-
turers.

the citadel is out of the hands of the varkonin, and what-
ever mysteries or power the strange complex held, are now
gone to all but the githyanki, that enigmatic race of zealot
warriors.
if the adventurers managed to retrieve the bodies of the
adventurers, they can be brought back and raised from the
dead by the factions. if all four adventurers are rescued,
give the story award in your debt.
the harpers and order of the gauntlet: randyll black-
albuck is sad to hear of the structure’s disappearance, but
such couldn’t be helped. the varkonin had a massive force
arriving to secure it. as a harper, he seeks to safeguard the
realms, gather knowledge, and make inroads to any and
all cultures. when such an opportunity is lost, he can’t help
but feel melancholy.
the kroth magg: hrogar and valrath kahn are not
disappointed with the outcome. the varkonin do not hold
the citadel and what power it might have possessed. they
consider the mission a fine success and congratulate the he-
roes. award each adventurer the hobgoblin accolade vadd
narkoz (see decorations in hobgoblin society below for
details).
if an adventurer already possesses vadd narkoz, he or
she is awarded lozz nying. lozz nying may be earned
multiple times.
the adventurers earn 75 gp for recovering information
on the citadel as well as 25 gp for each missing adventurer
recovered, 50 per missing adventurer if the adventurers
successfully haggled.

vadd narkoz, “strong warrior”. in this public procla-
mation, the hobgoblins of glip dak acknowledge outsiders
as worthy allies.

pony, bridle, and riding saddle are bestowed upon those
who earned lozz nying.
fezik melko, “worthy accord”. a parade occurs, and
those given the fezik melko are rewarded with a silver
dagger.

goblin creates a blood debt. until that debt is repaid, the
hobgoblin who owes the debt is known as the pakk vit

running this adventure at a convention
there are many paths to follow in blue scales, but if you
are running it on a tight timeline, you will probably have to
streamline it. use the adventure primer on pages 3-4 and
the story beats for each part as a roadmap and consider
the below suggestions for running this adventure when you
only have a two-hour slot.
part 1: ask upfront if anyone has story awards from
glip 01-01 or -02. if not, run sections d and e (adding c
if any lords alliance faction members are present). there
are plenty of opportunities for roleplaying with hrogar.
part 2: omit the cave fisher encounter from the chosen
track.
part 3: remove part b, or at least the gas spore, from
that chamber.
if time is no object
if your play group has the time, this adventure can easily
run four hours.
part 1: ask upfront if anyone has story awards from
glip 01-01- or -02. if not, run sections d and e, (adding c
if any lords alliance faction members are present.) there
are plenty of opportunities for roleplaying with hrogar.
part 2: run 2b followed by 2a. this will allow the
adventures a trip through the troll hills, then the under-
ground river to the final scene.
part 3: be careful about piling too much stuff in the final
battle, this can easily become a deadly encounter.

• if asked about what possible wealth a behir could have

hrogar suggests one of the following three approaches
to the cave, and gives the adventurers a crude map (player
handout 4) that shows the route to each:
• following the vaws-fohaklyam (“murderer’s creek” in
common, so named because of the trolls that stalk the area)
from its headwaters as it goes underground to eventually
exit the cliff cave (part 2a. over the river).
• follow the thashlohk (“bloated trail” in common, an
old drover’s trail) into the troll hills and look for yauch, a
duergar hermit who is rumored to know the hills inside and
out (part 2b. through the woods).
• if neither of those two options appeals to the party,
hrogar offers them two potions of climbing and suggests
a frontal assault up the cliff. he laughs loudly at this idea
(part 2c. up the cliff).
other things hrogar knows that he may divulge to the
adventurers:
• he suspects the behir has been lured to the area to
cause trouble for the kroth magg, but not by whom.
• the behir is rumored to be named “stonejaws”. a
successful dc 18 intelligence (history) check (dragonborn
and those with the sage or hermit background have advan-
tage on this role) recall that stonejaws is a behir infamous
for hunting dragons throughout the sea of fallen stars be-
side the forces of tymanther, where she earned a reputation
for both her brutality and cunning.
• behirs are known to hate dragons, and the two crea-
tures attempt to slay each other on sight.
• signs of magic (unusual burning, acid puddles) were
discovered around the sites of several of the raids. hrogar
is unsure of what this means. either stonejaw has magic at
her disposal or she might have allies.

the following npcs are featured prominently in this
adventure:
stonejaws (stohn-jaws). a behir of above-average
intelligence and an overdeveloped sense of grandeur. she
is an experienced hunter of dragons. stonejaws has been
recruited by an unknown (at this point) rival of the kroth
magg. convincing her was easy once she learned that the
hobgoblins’ patron was one of the behir-kind’s ancient
enemies, a blue dragon.
yauch (yoch). a duergar wizard and skilled spy. he
is a mercenary working with stonejaws. yauch has been a
surface dweller for more than 50 years and being out in the
sunlight no longer hinders him.
yauch is an avaricious wizard and hopes that this assign-
ment will allow him access to a defeated dragon’s hoard.
hrogar (row-gar). hobgoblin captain of the guard. he
has been on many campaigns with the kroth magg legion,
but his job now is law and order. proud but practical, hrog-
ar will ask for help to get a job done. he is by-the-book and
can be counted on to keep his word. as civilized and cul-
tured as he might appear, he is a cunning warrior at heart.

greetings,
i need a cloak or redknife to track down some missing tomes that are
rumored to be in area of glip dak. three volumes of the encyclope-
dia draconica were stolen from the saj family of mulmaster. the al-
liance has been charged with recovering them. fortune has favored
us; the famous augur of hulburg, lumin fetterbond, has used his di-
vining talents to discover the whereabouts and identity of the thief.
his name is yauch, and he is a duergar.
lumin’s spells have located yauch in glip dak. my messenger knows
the signs of our order and will present this missive to the first alli-
ance agent he sees.
find this yauch, secure the books, and bring them back to the messen-
ger. “encourage” yauch not to steal from the saj family again.
