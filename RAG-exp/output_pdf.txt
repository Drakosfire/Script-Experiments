the mIssIon
Hrogar can share the following information with the
adventures about Manke:
• Find Manke, take the sword from him anyway you can,
humiliate or kill him, whatever suits your style. Killing him
won’t violate the laws of Glip Dak. Hrogar will see to that.
• He has been attempting to convert others to his banner,
forming a sort of church militant.
• It is important to the functioning of Glip Dak that one
religion does not rise to control the city. A theocracy would
be devastating, especially one as violent as Maglubiyet.
A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recalls
that hobgoblins are supposed to worship Maglubiyet with
fanatical zeal, with few exceptions. Glip Dak hosts few
religious shrines or temples. The Kroth Magg say this is an
issue of attracting trade and making others feel comfortable
and safe within Glip Dak as Maglubiyet demands sacrific-
es.
aBout the sWord
The sword has quite the history. It was once wielded by
the troll mercenary Arrk before he disappeared into the
ruins below Glip Dak.
• The sword was recovered from there not long ago and
fell into the possession of Manke.
• The sword is of Netherese make and when drawn, the
blade bleeds. From what little we know, this must be some
kind of benign curse, well, unless you’re squeamish around
blood.
• At the center of its guard is a magical gem, which once
allowed the sword to capture and cast powerful magic.
However, something unusual is now within the sword
preventing this ability.

Weapon (greatsword), uncommon
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls

Arrk was a troll mercenary known for his brutali-
ty, loyalty, and reliability. He worked throughout the
Moonsea region and was infamous for carrying an
enchanted greatsword that dripped blood whenever it
was unsheathed, which Arrk would lick when he was
bored or annoyed.
Arrk vanished decades ago while exploring an
ancient ruin in the Troll Hills of Thar. His sword was
recovered not long after the founding of Glip Dak.
While the sword could once store and release powerful
spells, something unusual is now stored within and
refuses to be released.
The greatsword has a long, rune covered blade that
drips blood whenever the sword is unsheathed. The
wide blade is decorated with Netherese runes and the
handle is wrapped in basilisk hide. A large gem pulses
at the center of the cross guard.

doesn’t trust the competency of outsiders, but the increase
in thefts have left him tired and frustrated. Feeling that his
back is to the wall, Hrogar is willing to trust mercenaries.
It isn’t that Hrogar is lazy, but he feels he can best serve the
community by staying on the streets.
He knows the following:
• Roughly two tendays ago, burglary complaints in Glip
Dak spiked, both from residents and non-residents.
• The stolen items are all on the small side—coins,
gems, silverware, knick-knacks, etc. Taken together
though, it amounts to a small fortune.
• Some of the burglary reports included claims of large
rats being the offenders, dragging the stolen goods away
into the night. Servants at three burglarized homes were
found bitten to death. Hrogar has not made this information
public.
• At first, Hrogar thought that Grat Nying, the city’s
thieves’ guild, might be responsible, but quickly dismissed
the idea. The guild has a good racket going and avoids do-
ing anything to jeopardize it. The dead servants and reports
of large rats have confirmed the notion that Grat Nying is

rewards: “Who can say what happened to all the stolen

the adventurers to make haste, and report back before two

• If asked about his nickname, Strenkl sighs, “I get asked
that a lot. I’ll tell you if you succeed.”
Strenkl gives the adventurers directions to the sewer
access and a key to open the sewer door.

Members of the Harper Faction may at this point want to
track down Strob at the Pickled Crawler shop to steal back
Randyll Blackalbuck’s golden box. If they ask for direc-
tions, someone they encounter can point them to Strob’s
shop.
Read or paraphrase the following:
Mixed in with the market shops are more
unusual vendors.
One shop in particular has a jar with a pickled
carrion crawler head on display in the window,
along with desiccated humanoid body parts and
a selection of crisp-fried skewered rats. The
sign above reads Strave Stek Macga, and bears
an image of a carrion crawler.
Inside you see a one-eyed duergar behind the
counter. He looks up at you, squinting through a
crystal monocle. “Eh, customers? How can old
Strob help you all? Have you come looking for
something?”
What Strob knows:
• He claims not to have the gold box anymore and says:
“I should have sold it back! I’m out a small fortune on that
dratted box!” If the adventurers are suspicious of Strob’s
claim, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals
this to be true.
• If pressed, Strob will confess to his shop being burgled
recently. He states the thieves stole only small things “that
could easily be fenced somewhere else.”
• After a few minutes of discussion, Strob will urge
the adventurers to “buy something, or be on about your
business!”

e. raxIvort, arIse!
In the main chamber of Grimyton, speaker Uublix (a
warlock of the Archfey) is finishing the final steps in cast-
ing conjure fey, mistakenly thinking he will cause Raxivort
to appear.
Read or paraphrase the following:
In the main chamber, some two dozen xvarts
are watching a tall gold-robed xvart standing
atop a mound of coins, silverware, rugs, and the
like, intoning words of power.
Before him is a censer with scented smoke
wafting towards the ceiling. Behind the xvart,
partly concealed in the shadows, is the hulking
figure of a giant rat-beast.

Uublix has unwittingly made a warlock pact with an
unknown otherworldly being but assumes the patron is
really Raxivort. As speaker of the xvart tribe, Uublix has
“supreme authority over Grimyton”, and loves to let the
other xvarts know it.

“Bow down before your new master!”
“You’ll pay for this treachery!”
“Speaketh not the name of Raxivort!”

If the party arrives at the xvart main chamber without
Slobar, and doesn’t stop the summoning ceremony, a fight
is inevitable as Uublix cries out for his tribe to “destroy the
intruders!”
If they do stop the ceremony, see the Negotiate section
above.
At the completion of Uublix’s ceremony, he casts conjure
fey, believing he is summoning the xvart god. A number of
things happen:

Warlock of the Archfey. Uublix is completely insane and
has made the broad leap that since he summoned an ally
instead of his god, he must be a god! He is still a craven
god, however, and will use his magic, outside of cantrips,
mainly to keep away from danger by using misty step. The
first time he takes damage, he will use Misty Escape. For
offense, he uses eldritch blast.
Half-ogre/ogre. Rattus is a large, not-at-all-bright brute.
Unbidden, he will attack the nearest creature who is not
blue (Wild Magic sorcerers who have recently surged and
rolled a 23-24 will find this to their advantage).
Meenlock. The meenlock will attack as Ublix com-
mands. It will make use of Shadow Teleport as much as
possible, mainly to get out of melee. If Uublix loses con-
centration, the meenlock will target him solely.
Redcap. The redcap will attack as Ublix commands.
Given the chance, it will use Ironbound Pursuit, otherwise
it will use its Wicked Sickle. If Uublix loses concentration,
the redcap will target him solely, taking special delight if it
can knock the xvart off his stilts.
Yeth hound. The yeth hound will alternate using its bay
and its bite, attacking as Uublix commands. If Uublix loses
concentration, the yeth hound will target him solely.

Keen Hearing and Smell. The yeth hound has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or

Sunlight Banishment. If the yeth hound starts its turn
in sunlight, it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. While
sunlight shines on the spot from which it vanished, the
hound must remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it
returns to the Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon
it typically sets out to find its pack or its master. The hound
is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border
Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can’t affect or be affected
by anything on the other plane. Once it is adjacent to its
master or a pack mate that is on the Material Plane, a yeth
hound in the Border Ethereal can return to the Material
Plane as an action.
Telepathic Bond. While the yeth hound is on the same
plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey
what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate
telepathically with each other.

psychic damage if the target is frightened.
Baleful Baying. The yeth hound bays magically. Every
enemy within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must
succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
until the end of the hound’s next turn or until the hound is
incapacitated. A frightened target that starts its turn within
30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn
to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the
move before taking an action, and must take the most direct
route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successful-
ly saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the
next 24 hours.

The NPC providing the mission warns the adventurers
that Thar can be quite cold this time of year, and to make
sure to purchase cold-weather gear if they don’t already
have some or if it hasn’t already been provided (see the
Extreme Cold sidebar).
extreMe cold
Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees
Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
or gain one level or exhaustion. Creatures with resistance
or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the
saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear
(thick coats, gloves, and the like), and creatures naturally
adapted to cold climates.
Travel to the citadel is not covered in this module be-
cause of the adventure’s time restraints. However, if time
is not an issue, then the Level 1-5 Arctic Encounters Table
can be used from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, page 92.

The Githyanki citadel has the following features.
Terrain. The citadel is sunken into the bog, tilting the
entire structure. It is carved from a single, massive tooth.
A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies
that this molar-like tooth came from a titanic creature
belonging to the Far Realm. Detect magic reveals that the
tooth was shaped using immense psionic powers.
Weather. The inside of the citadel is dry and cold.
Light. All rooms (A-U) are brightly lit by red-hued orbs
set into the ceiling. Occasionally the orbs flicker in unison,

If the adventurers haven’t already found the mithral half

defeated in this room. These treasures can only be awarded
once, so if the armor or helm are found elsewhere in the

The adventurers also find 55 gp in various coinage.

Siding with the Githyanki at this point should be diffi-

for elves, who they have encountered in Astral space in
elvish ships and who they view with annoyance instead of
abject disdain.

The citadel is out of the hands of the Varkonin, and what-
ever mysteries or power the strange complex held, are now
gone to all but the Githyanki, that enigmatic race of zealot
warriors.
If the adventurers managed to retrieve the bodies of the
adventurers, they can be brought back and raised from the
dead by the factions. If all four adventurers are rescued,
give the Story Award In Your Debt.
The Harpers and Order of the Gauntlet: Randyll Black-
albuck is sad to hear of the structure’s disappearance, but
such couldn’t be helped. The Varkonin had a massive force
arriving to secure it. As a Harper, he seeks to safeguard the
Realms, gather knowledge, and make inroads to any and
all cultures. When such an opportunity is lost, he can’t help
but feel melancholy.
The Kroth Magg: Hrogar and Valrath Kahn are not
disappointed with the outcome. The Varkonin do not hold
the citadel and what power it might have possessed. They
consider the mission a fine success and congratulate the he-
roes. Award each adventurer the hobgoblin accolade Vadd
Narkoz (see Decorations in Hobgoblin Society below for
details).
If an adventurer already possesses Vadd Narkoz, he or
she is awarded Lozz Nying. Lozz Nying may be earned
multiple times.
The adventurers earn 75 gp for recovering information
on the citadel as well as 25 gp for each missing adventurer
recovered, 50 per missing adventurer if the adventurers
successfully haggled.

The adventurers recently befriended a Glip Dak faction
with some work in the ruins below the city.

ago, you set out from Hulburg with a mission to pay the
ransom on Elias Vandover. Now that that mission is ac-

that doesn’t involve you footing the bill.
Get Our Books Back (Lords’ Alliance Faction Assign-
ment). Prior to being hired to spy on Glip Dak, many years
ago, the duergar mage Yauch stole a valuable collection of
dragon-lore books from the Saj family in Mulmaster.
Yauch disguised himself as Lumin Fetterbond, a respect-
ed dwarf cleric from Hulburg. When representatives of the
Saj family caught up to Lumin, the deception was uncov-

running thiS Adventure At A convention
There are many paths to follow in Blue Scales, but if you
are running it on a tight timeline, you will probably have to
streamline it. Use the Adventure Primer on pages 3-4 and
the Story Beats for each part as a roadmap and consider
the below suggestions for running this adventure when you
only have a two-hour slot.
Part 1: Ask upfront if anyone has story awards from
GLIP 01-01 or -02. If not, run sections D and E (adding C
if any Lords Alliance faction members are present). There
are plenty of opportunities for roleplaying with Hrogar.
Part 2: Omit the Cave Fisher encounter from the chosen
track.
Part 3: Remove Part B, or at least the gas spore, from
that chamber.
iF tiMe iS no oBject
If your play group has the time, this adventure can easily
run four hours.
Part 1: Ask upfront if anyone has story awards from
GLIP 01-01- or -02. If not, run sections D and E, (adding C
if any Lords Alliance faction members are present.) There
are plenty of opportunities for roleplaying with Hrogar.
Part 2: Run 2b followed by 2a. This will allow the
adventures a trip through the Troll Hills, then the under-
ground river to the final scene.
Part 3: Be careful about piling too much stuff in the final
battle, this can easily become a deadly encounter.

ambushed and looted supply lines, including those carrying

Hrogar suggests one of the following three approaches
to the cave, and gives the adventurers a crude map (Player
Handout 4) that shows the route to each:
• Following the Vaws-fohaklyam (“Murderer’s Creek” in
Common, so named because of the trolls that stalk the area)
from its headwaters as it goes underground to eventually
exit the cliff cave (Part 2a. Over the River).
• Follow the Thashlohk (“Bloated Trail” in Common, an
old drover’s trail) into the Troll Hills and look for Yauch, a
duergar hermit who is rumored to know the hills inside and
out (Part 2b. Through the Woods).
• If neither of those two options appeals to the party,
Hrogar offers them two potions of climbing and suggests
a frontal assault up the cliff. He laughs loudly at this idea
(Part 2c. Up the Cliff).
Other things Hrogar knows that he may divulge to the
adventurers:
• He suspects the behir has been lured to the area to
cause trouble for the Kroth Magg, but not by whom.
• The behir is rumored to be named “Stonejaws”. A
successful DC 18 Intelligence (History) check (dragonborn
and those with the sage or hermit background have advan-
tage on this role) recall that Stonejaws is a behir infamous
for hunting dragons throughout the Sea of Fallen Stars be-
side the forces of Tymanther, where she earned a reputation
for both her brutality and cunning.
• Behirs are known to hate dragons, and the two crea-
tures attempt to slay each other on sight.
• Signs of magic (unusual burning, acid puddles) were
discovered around the sites of several of the raids. Hrogar
is unsure of what this means. Either Stonejaw has magic at
her disposal or she might have allies.

The following NPCs are featured prominently in this
adventure:
Stonejaws (STOHN-jaws). A behir of above-average
intelligence and an overdeveloped sense of grandeur. She
is an experienced hunter of dragons. Stonejaws has been
recruited by an unknown (at this point) rival of the Kroth
Magg. Convincing her was easy once she learned that the
hobgoblins’ patron was one of the behir-kind’s ancient
enemies, a blue dragon.
Yauch (YOCH). A duergar wizard and skilled spy. He
is a mercenary working with Stonejaws. Yauch has been a
surface dweller for more than 50 years and being out in the
sunlight no longer hinders him.
Yauch is an avaricious wizard and hopes that this assign-
ment will allow him access to a defeated dragon’s hoard.
Hrogar (ROW-gar). Hobgoblin captain of the guard. He
has been on many campaigns with the Kroth Magg legion,
but his job now is law and order. Proud but practical, Hrog-
ar will ask for help to get a job done. He is by-the-book and
can be counted on to keep his word. As civilized and cul-
tured as he might appear, he is a cunning warrior at heart.

Greetings,
I need a Cloak or Redknife to track down some missing tomes that are rumored to be in area of Glip Dak. Three vol-
umes of the Encyclopedia Draconica were stolen from the Saj family of Mulmaster. The Alliance has been charged with
recovering them. Fortune has favored us; the famous augur of Hulburg, Lumin Fetterbond, has used his divining talents to
discover the whereabouts and identity of the thief. His name is Yauch, and he is a duergar.
Lumin’s spells have located Yauch in Glip Dak. My messenger knows the signs of our order and will present this mis-
sive to the first Alliance agent he sees.
Find this Yauch, secure the books, and bring them back to the messenger. “Encourage” Yauch not to steal from the Saj
family again.
-Lord Pyotr Iredale
