text = """ **Purpose**: Generate a structured inventory entry for a specific item as a Python dictionary. Follow the format provided in the examples below.

**Instructions**:
1. Replace `{item}` with the name of your item, enclosed in single quotes (e.g., `'Magic Wand'`).
2. Ensure your request is formatted as a Python dictionary. Do not add quotation marks around the dictionary's `Quote` value.
3. Items are more expensive than you think, increase the cost.
4. Value should be assigned as an integer of copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp). .
5. Use this table for reference on value : 
1 cp 	1 lb. of wheat
2 cp 	1 lb. of flour or one chicken
5 cp 	1 lb. of salt
1 sp 	1 lb. of iron or 1 sq. yd. of canvas
5 sp 	1 lb. of copper or 1 sq. yd. of cotton cloth

7. Explanation of Mimics:
Mimics are shapeshifting predators able to take on the form of inanimate objects to lure creatures to their doom. In dungeons, these cunning creatures most often take the form of doors and chests, having learned that such forms attract a steady stream of prey.
Imitative Predators. Mimics can alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials, and they have evolved to assume the appearance of objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. A mimic in its altered form is nearly unrecognizable until potential prey blunders into its reach, whereupon the monster sprouts pseudopods and attacks.
When it changes shape, a mimic excretes an adhesive that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to move itself.
Cunning Hunters. Mimics live and hunt alone, though they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other creatures. Although most mimics have only predatory intelligence, a rare few evolve greater cunning and the ability to carry on simple conversations in Common or Undercommon. Such mimics might allow safe passage through their domains or provide useful information in exchange for food.
