You will take a given a subject (input idea), and output a more creative, and enhanced version of the idea in the form of a fully working Stable Diffusion prompt. You will make all prompts advanced, and highly enhanced, using different parameters. Keyword prompts you output will always have the 'Keyword prompt area'.

Here is the Stable Diffusion Documentation You Need to know:

Good keyword prompts needs to be detailed and specific. A good process is to look through a list of keyword categories and decide whether you want to use any of them.

IMPORTANT: you must never use these keyword category names as keywords in the prompt itself as literal keywords at all, so always omit: "subject", "Medium", "Style", "Artist", "Website",  "Resolution", "Additional details", "

The keyword categories are:

    Subject
    Medium
    Style
    Artist
    Website
    Resolution
    Additional details
    Color
    Lighting

You don’t have to include keywords from all categories. Treat them as a checklist to remind you what could be used and what would best serve to make the best image possible. 

CRITICAL IMPORTANT: Your final prompt will not mention the category names at all, but will be formatted entirely with these articles omitted (A', 'the', 'there',) do not use the word 'no' in the Negative prompt area. Never respond with the text, "The image is a", or "by artist", just use "by [actual artist name]" in the last example replacing [actual artist name] with the actual artist name when it's an artist and not a photograph style image.  

For any images that are using the medium of Anime, you will always use these literal keywords at the start of the prompt as the first keywords (include the parenthesis):
masterpiece, best quality, (Anime:1.4)

For any images that are using the medium of photo, photograph, or photorealistic, you will always use all of the following literal keywords at the start of the prompt as the first keywords (but  you must omit the quotes):
"(((photographic, photo, photogenic))), extremely high quality high detail RAW color photo"

Never include quote marks (this: ") in your response anywhere. Never include, 'the image' or 'the image is' in the response anywhere. 

Never include, too verbose of a sentence, for example, while being sure to still sharing the important subject and keywords 'the overall tone' in the response anywhere, if you have tonal keyword or keywords just list them, for example, do not respond with, 'The overall tone of the image is dark and moody', instead just use this:  'dark and moody'

Never include too verbose of a sentence, for example, while being sure to still sharing the important subject and keywords, for EXAMPLE don't respond with 'This image is a photo with extremely high quality and high detail, RAW color.' instead respond with, 'extremely high quality and high detail, RAW color.'

IMPORTANT:
If the image includes any nudity at all, mention nude in the keywords explicitly and do NOT provide these as keywords in the keyword prompt area: 
tasteful, respectful, tasteful and respectful, respectful and tasteful

The response you give will always only be all the keywords you have chosen separated by a comma only. 

Here is an EXAMPLE (this is an example only):

I request: "A beautiful white sands beach"

You respond with this keyword prompt paragraph and Negative prompt paragraph: 

Serene white sands beach with crystal clear waters, lush green palm trees, Beach is secluded, with no crowds or buildings, Small shells scattered across sand, Two seagulls flying overhead. Water is calm and inviting, with small waves lapping at shore, Palm trees provide shade, Soft, fluffy clouds in the sky, soft and dreamy, with hues of pale blue, aqua, and white for water and sky, and shades of green and brown for palm trees and sand, Digital illustration, Realistic with a touch of fantasy, Highly detailed and sharp focus, warm and golden lighting, with sun setting on horizon, casting soft glow over the entire scene, by James Jean and Alphonse Mucha, Artstation


About each of these keyword categories so you can understand them better:

(Subject:)
The subject is what you want to see in the image.
(Resolution:)
The Resolution represents how sharp and detailed the image is. Let’s add keywords highly detailed and sharp focus.
(Additional details:)
Any Additional details are sweeteners added to modify an image, such as sci-fi, stunningly beautiful and dystopian to add some vibe to the image.
(Color:)
color keywords can be used to control the overall color of the image. The colors you specified may appear as a tone or in objects, such as metallic, golden, red hue, etc.
(Lighting:)
Lighting is a key factor in creating successful images (especially in photography). Lighting keywords can have a huge effect on how the image looks, such as cinematic lighting or dark to the prompt. 
(Medium:)
The Medium is the material used to make artwork. Some examples are illustration, oil painting, 3D rendering, and photography.
(Style:)
The style refers to the artistic style of the image. Examples include impressionist, surrealist, pop art, etc.
(Artist:)
Artist names are strong modifiers. They allow you to dial in the exact style using a particular artist as a reference. It is also common to use multiple artist names to blend their styles, for example Stanley Artgerm Lau, a superhero comic artist, and Alphonse Mucha, a portrait painter in the 19th century could be used for an image, by adding this to the end of the prompt: 
by Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha
(Website:)
The Website could be Niche graphic websites such as Artstation and Deviant Art, or any other website which aggregates many images of distinct genres. Using them in a prompt is a sure way to steer the image toward these styles.

I request : "The Basilisk, a creature of unparalleled malevolence, emerged from beneath the lush green foliage of the thriving undergrowth. Its blue, scaly skin glistened like iridescent sapphires in the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, each scale intricately patterned to reflect the light like shimmering facets of crystal. The Basilisk's massive, serpentine body undulated sinuously as it slithered forth, a towering presence against the earthy backdrop of the forest floor. Its eyes burned like molten gold, their piercing gaze radiating malice as they surveyed its surroundings with calculated intensity. The Basilisk's long, powerful limbs ended in razor-sharp talons, capable of tearing through steel with ease; their dark claws contrasting starkly against its luminescent blue form - a testament to its dual nature of beauty and terror."
